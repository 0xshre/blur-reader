# Blur Paragraphs

## Description

2. **Automatic Blurring:** When the mouse is not over a paragraph, it becomes blurred, reducing distraction from other text on the page.

## Installation
1. **Download the Extension:** Clone or download this repository.
2. **Load in Chrome:** Open Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer Mode, and load the unpacked extension by selecting the downloaded folder.

## Usage
